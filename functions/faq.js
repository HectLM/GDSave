        "a": "To save space, GD does not store the full info on every level you've ever downloaded. For most levels, only important info like percentage and star rating can be accessed, the latter of which can be used to roughly estimate the level's difficulty."

        "a": "Since the community votes on demon difficulties, their rating is constantly changing. Your save file bases the demon difficulty off of the last time you downloaded them, and it is very likely that some ratings changed since then. <u>Since new demon levels default to Hard, you may see more hard demons than usual.</u>",
